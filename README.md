Things that I'd like to improve:

    Verify Stock Symbols:
        Use a faster way to verify stock symbols than loop.
            - Use of array find() method not yet implemented.
        
    Article Images:
        Add images to the articles.

    Weblinks:
        Make website links active.
    
    Favorites w/cookies:
        Allow users to save favorite stocks with cookies.

    Optional content:
        Instead of clunky check boxes, allow users to select available fields from JSON using an object to display selections and an object to dynamically select content.
